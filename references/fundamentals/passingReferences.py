Passing References.

When a function is called, the values of the arguments are copied
to the parameter variables. For lists (and dictionaries), a copy of the
reference is used for the parameter.

To avoid mutating the original data, use py module copy - see below.

"""Even though spam and someParameter contain separate references, they
both refer to the same list. This is why the append('Hello') method call
