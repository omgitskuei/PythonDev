# The for statement in Python differs from what you may be used to in C or Pascal.
# Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers,
# or giving let user define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C),
# NOTE: Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over items of ANY sequence
# (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.

# Measure some strings (returning each of their lengths):
words = ['cat', 'door', 'screen']
for w in words:
	print(w, len(w), )



# Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:
# Strategy:  Iterate over a copy
for user, status in users.copy().items():
    if status == 'inactive':
        del users[user]

# Strategy:  Create a new collection
active_users = {}
for user, status in users.items():
    if status == 'active':
        active_users[user] = status



# for loop
# can take string, tuple, list
# it operates expression for each item in sequence, and repeats going to the next item in sequence, UNTIL no item left
# Below are 3 ways of writing a for loop that repeats 3 times
for var in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(var)

for i in range(3):
    print(i)

list1=[1,2,3]
for i in range(len(list1)):
    print(i)



# nested loops
# nested for:
for i in range(1, 5):			# range(1,5) means 1, 2, 3, 4
    for j in range(1, 5):		# ... 5 is exclusive, so never printed
        x=i*j
        print(i, j, x)
    print()						# total number times ran is 4*4
