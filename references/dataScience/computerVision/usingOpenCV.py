Open CV
The open-source computer vision library, Open-CV,
is your best friend when it comes to images and videos.
It offers great efficient solutions to common image problems
such as face detection and object detection.

Or, as we can see below, Edge detection,
the process of detecting various lines inside an image.
If you are planning to work with images in data science,
this library is a must.

Open CV gathered a massive 56,000 stars on Github and made working with
image data several times faster and easier for me.
