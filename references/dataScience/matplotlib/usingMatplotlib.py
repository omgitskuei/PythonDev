Matplotlib

Data visualization is your main way to communicate with non-Data Wizards.
If you think about it, even apps are merely a way to visualize various
data interactions behind the scene.

Matplolib is the basis of image visualization in Python.
From visualizing your edge detection algorithm to looking at distributions
in your data, Matplolib is your partner in crime.

14,000 stars on GitHub and surely a great library to start contributing to.

I made, for example, this animated lineplot in a recent video using
seaborn and matplotlib.
